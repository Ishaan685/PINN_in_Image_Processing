- This project is aimed at processing noisy images using the Perona-Malik differential equation approximated using a Neural Network keeping the initial and boundary conditions in mind for the same.

- The main implementation code is present in the `.ipynb` file which includes implementations for both `Physics informed Neural Network` as well as `Finite Difference Method Model`.
